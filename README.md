### New README.md who this?

Hello! We're the **Orrery Endurant**, formerly known as ~~the **Spindrift Crew**~~, ~~**Spindrift Games**~~,
or ~~**Cadera Spindrift.**~~

We're a median [plural system](http://morethanone.info) of around 6 individuals.

Collectively, we use the name **Laurel O. Valentine** when a singlet-style name is needed.

### WoW Addons

We used to make roleplaying addons for *World of Warcraft* but are no longer doing so, apart from the
occasional version bump or maintenance release.

### Tabletop RPGs

Most of our attention is focused on creating tabletop roleplaying games. 

#### Process

We write the TRPGs in separate markdown files, join them together with a lua script, dump the whole thing 
into PANDOC to create HTML, and then join the HTML with CSS to create PDFs using PrinceXML.
