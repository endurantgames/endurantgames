<p>Hello and welcome to <b>Endurant Games</b>, the personal TRPG design studio
of <b>Laurel O. Valentine</b> and <i>The Orrery Endurant.</i>

<p>The <b>Orrery Endurant</b> is a median, polyam, queer, transfeminine OSDD-1
<a href="https://morethanone.info">plural system</a> of about 7 individuals.
Laurel is our designated frontwoman, which makes us sound a bit like a rock
band, which is cooler than we really are. We're also a cancer survivor and have
been playing TRPGs since around 1980. We'll answer to Laurel, Aura, Val, or
Orrery.</p>

<prUntil March 2023, we published games as <b>Cadera Spindrift</b> of
<b>Spindrift Games.</b> We wanted to move away from the "Spindrift" name for
personal reasons.</p>

<p>Right now we're in the process of updating our domain, our usernames, our
logos, our content, and our website, so it's possible that some things might be
a bit of jumble for a while.</p>
